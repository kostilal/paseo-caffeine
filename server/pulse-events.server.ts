/**
 * The events Paseo Pulse reads with a cursor (`caffeine.pulse-events`, server/pulse.server.ts):
 * heat guard trips, lid mode that ended by itself, warm-ups that failed. Kept in memory only,
 * the newest CAPACITY of them; a restart starts an empty buffer, and a cursor from before it
 * reads as a gap, so Pulse knows something may have been missed rather than hearing nothing.
 *
 * Ids are the wall clock in milliseconds, zero-padded so they sort as strings, and always one
 * more than the last: they keep their order across a restart as long as the clock does.
